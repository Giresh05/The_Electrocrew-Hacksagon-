# üåã Landslide Detection System ‚Äì ElectroCrew

**A resilient edge-AI system for early landslide detection using ESP32 and CH32 microcontrollers.**  
Now with TCP-to-PC communication and real-time data plotting ‚Äî plus an ensemble of Isolation Forest + River's HalfSpaceTrees for hybrid anomaly detection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

This multi-node, low-power sensor mesh detects landslide-related anomalies by fusing data from environmental and motion sensors. It communicates with a PC using a custom TCP server and visualizes sensor trends in real time.

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

| Phase        | Model              | Purpose                                |
|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Offline      | Isolation Forest   | Trained on collected data for static profiling. |
| Online       | HalfSpaceTrees     | Live adaptation using `river`.         |
| Final Output | Hybrid Ensemble    | Combines both for robust detection.    |

### ‚úÖ Ensemble Hybrid Validation  
- Outputs from both models are fused.  
- Ensures lower false positive/negative rate than using either alone.  
- Output: `"normal"`, `"suspicious"`, or `"likely"` anomaly.

## üì∂ TCP Communication with PC

The ESP32 runs a **TCP server** on port `80`. The Python script connects to it to:

- Request live sensor data from `/sensor_data?nodeId=x`
- Control the system via `/set_mode` endpoint

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint         | Method | Description                            |
|------------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `/sensor_data`   | GET    | Returns latest sensor payload          |
| `/set_mode`      | POST   | Set mode: `Standby` / `Data Collection`|

---

## üìä Real-Time Plotting (Python)

Python script polls sensor data over TCP and plots:

- Accelerometer (X, Y, Z)
- Rain/Soil analog values
- Live anomaly score
- Decision result (annotated)
